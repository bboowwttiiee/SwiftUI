# SwiftUI
Apps or some interesting features developed using SwiftUI framework and sometimes small implementations of UIKit

                "body" : "In-app Notification using Dynamic Island!!!"
            },
            "badge" : 0
        },
        "Simulator Target Bundle" : "com.bowtie.Dynamic-Island"
    }
